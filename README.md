# University of Minnesota Rocket League - Website UI

This repository contains the source code for the University of Minnesota (UMN) Rocket League club website. It is created with TypeScript to help developers gain useful skills in understanding JavaScript and React types. Only current students will be contributing to this repository UNLESS clear permission is given to a non-student (high school, alumni, faculty member, etc.).

## Development Team & Contributors

- Matt "TitanHawk17" Dixey: _Project Mentor_
- Corbin "Nut" Donner: _Project Engineer_

## Developer Instructions

This project is built on TypeScript React, meaning that everything needs to be typed (number, string, object, array, etc.). You can expect to learn how to call APIs and receive data, create reusable components with React, all levels of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and what professional standards are when it comes to Software Engineering.

The basic structure of the application is already implemented for you. If you would like to know how this was completed, either reach out to the _Project Mentor_ or conduct your own research. You are expected to:

- Work with your fellow developers to construct a modern, beautiful website to properly show off UMN Rocket League
- Follow the instructions left in other READMEs throughout the project
- Ask questions if you spend more than 30 minutes working on a single issue
- Work on your own time as this is a project designed for you to be committed at whatever level you feel comfortable with

You may create your own files within this repository as you will need them to complete the project.
You may code in any way you'd like as long as the code is readable and understandable for current and future developer team members.
You may copy the link to this repository to post on your resume, LinkedIn, or any page that displays your portfolio. In fact, this is highly encouraged.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository - `git clone git@github.com:UMN-RL-Devs/umnrl-ui.git`
2. Open the project folder in VSCode or an IDE of your choice. VSCode is highly recommended due to the extensions that will make programming more efficient.
3. Open a terminal and run the command `npm install`. Make sure you are inside the project folder (`umnrl-ui`). This step make take a few minutes to complete initially.
4. To verify that you can run the project, run the command `npm start`. This should open a new window in your default browser navigating to https://localhost:3000
5. Report any errors to the _Project Mentor_ if you can't complete these steps.

## Contributing

This repository and all repositories in the UMN-RL-Devs GitHub organization will prevent developers from pushing directly to the main branch. The only way developers can merge their changes is via **pull requests**. Here is the general process for contributing to UMN-RL-Devs:

1. Ensure that you have cloned the repository you'd like to contribute to.
2. Ensure that you are on the `main` branch by executing the command `git checkout main`.
3. Ensure that all the code is up-to-date by executing the command `git pull`.
4. Create a new branch using the following command: `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`. Replace `BRANCH_NAME` with a short, but descriptive name of your changes. For example, if adding a Navbar component, the command you are executing should be similar to `git checkout -b feat/navbar`. Please try to have each branch be preceded by one of the following:

- `feat/` = New feature you are adding
- `enhance/` = Enhancement to an existing feature
- `bug/` = Implementing a bug fix to an existing feature
- `test/` = Adding test cases or experimenting with a possible new feature

5. Implement your changes to the codebase. Once you are confident, push your changes:

- `git add .` = Add all the changes you've made in the current directory
- `git commit -m "commit message explaining what you did"` = Commit your changes locally, adding in a short descriptive message with what you did.
- `git push` = Push your changes to the remote repository. If this is your first time pushing from your branch, the terminal will inform you of a different command you only need to run when pushing for the first time from a branch. Otherwise, this command will work.

6. Navigate to the repository via https://github.com. There should be a prompt to create a Pull Request. Click that!
7. Fill out the details of the Pull Request. The title should be very similar to your branch name. The description should explain in more detail what you did and the benefit your changes bring to the codebase. Feel free to add screenshots too!
8. On the right hand side, request a review from your fellow developers and/or the _Project Mentor_.
9. Pull requests are required to have one person confirm your changes look good and benefit the application. If approved, you can merge them into the `main` branch. Most likely, you will receive feedback for changes you can make to your code to improve some aspect of it (readability, performance, redundancy, etc.). That is okay as this will build good code practices and standards.
10. Repeat this process for each new change you add.

# React Generated README

The content from here on out is automatically generated when creating a new React project. Use it as you may as there is some helpful information.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
