# components Folder

This is where you will spend most of your time programming. All of your React components must be inside this folder. It would be wise to group these files based on their relation to each other. Here are two examples:

1. I'm creating a Navbar that will have a Logo component, Links component, and a Socials component. It would be best to group these in a folder labeled `navbar`.
2. The Hero component I'm creating needs special styling to format the text, so my two files will be `Hero.tsx` and `Hero.css`. To help other developers understand these are closely related, let's put both of these in a folder labeled `hero`.

Essentially, use common sense when grouping files. This is a good habit to build early in your programming careers.
