## assets Folder

Inside the `assets` folder are all of your non-code, larger assets. These are commonly:

- .mp4, .mov, or .gif file types (videos)
- .jpeg, .png, or .bmp file types (images)
- Any instruction or template file

In terms of this project, these can include but are not limited to:

- Logos
- Event photos
- Event or club-related videos
- Adobe files

If some of these file sizes are too large, it may be best to add them to the `.gitignore` at the root of the project directory.

Please be sure to also create folders where necessary. For example, if you have many event photos, it would be wise to place them all in a separate directory inside the `assets` folder.
